# Trello

Clojure wrapper for the Trello API.

[Official Trello Docs](https://trello.com/docs/index.html) | [Official Trello API Reference](https://trello.com/docs/api/index.html)

This was forked from https://github.com/bsima/trello

- converted to deps.edn (through lein-tools-deps), so that it can be included in a project deps.edn file without uplaoding to Maven Central
- added :options to all Trello calls, to support operations such as multipart uploads


## Usage

Trello is available from Clojars.org. To use it, add the following as a dependency in Leiningen or Boot.

```clojure
[me.bsima/trello "0.3.0"]
```

# Usage

First, generate your api key and api token: [trello.com/1/appKey/generate](https://trello.com/1/appKey/generate)

From there you can obtain a key and secret from the Trello developer dashboard. Now you can make a client like so:

```clojure
user> (def auth {:key "..." :secret "..."})
nil
user> (require '[trello.core :refer [make-client]])
#<Var@a17a546: {:key "...", :secret "..."}>
user> (def client (make-client (:key auth) (:secret auth)))
#<Var@7d383c5d: #object[trello.core$callfn 0x6823295a "trello.core$callfn@6823295a"]>
```

With this client, you can make any request to a public Trello board that you want. You just need to use `trello.client/get`, which takes a resource as a string and an optional map of `:params`:

```clojure
user> (require '[trello.client :as t])
nil
user> (doc t/get)
-------------------------
trello.client/get
([resource & {params :params}])
  Calls a Trello API resource with optional params.
nil
user> (client t/get "boards/Tb4b74V5" :params {:members "all"})
{:closed false,
 :desc "",
 :pinned false,
 :name "My Trello Board",
...}

```

You can have more fine-grained control over calling specific API endpoints with `trello.client/api-call`

```clojure
user> (doc t/api-call)
-------------------------
trello.client/api-call
([method path & {:keys [params payload]}])
  Calls the Trello API with the provided endpoint, HTTP method, and
  params. Returns the response as a Clojure data
  structure (automatically parses the JSON response with
  clojure.data.json)
nil
user> (client t/api-call :GET "boards/my-board-id")
{:closed false,
 :desc "",
 :pinned false,
 :name "My Trello Board",
...}

```

If you want to access private Trello boards, you'll need to get an access token from Trello. To do this you can use the following URL

https://trello.com/1/authorize?key=YOURKEY&name=My+Application&expiration=never&response_type=token&scope=read,write

## Things Built with Trello and Clojure

The main reason I'm building this library is because I'm using it at [nebulabio/www](https://github.com/nebulabio/www), which is a Clojure web app hosted on Heroku meant for crowdfunding my open source biomedical engineering projects.

If you use this library to make something cool with Clojure and Trello, share it! Message me on Twitter [@bensima](https://twitter.com/bensima) or submit a PR or an issue here on GitHub with a link back to your project.

## Acknowledgements

This is a fork and rewrite of [boxuk/trello](https://github.com/boxuk/trello). Largely inspired by [@danielsz's clojure-etsy-api](https://github.com/danielsz/etsy-clojure-api) and [@ianbarber's clj-gapi](https://github.com/ianbarber/clj-gapi). In fact, some of the functions are borrowed from @danielsz, and mentioned as such in the function meta data. Thanks Daniel!
